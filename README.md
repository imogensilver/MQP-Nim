# The Nim Framework for Imogen Silver's Major Qualifying Project
This project implements a version of Jeurgen Schmidhuber's Optimal Ordered Problem Solver (OOPS) in a lisp-like, point-free language. The framework is written in [Nim](https://nim-lang.org), because it allows for large amounts of meta-programming and still compiles to C. It is expressive, elegant, and extremely powerful.
